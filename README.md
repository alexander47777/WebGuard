## Introduction
**[Framework Name]** is a customizable penetration testing framework designed for web application security testing. It automates common security assessments, including vulnerability scans and attack simulations, providing comprehensive reports to developers and security professionals.

## Features
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
- **Integration with third-party tools** such as OWASP ZAP and SQLmap
- **SSL/TLS checks** for certificate analysis
- **Header security analysis** for HTTP header compliance
- **Comprehensive PDF reporting**
- **Modular structure** for easy customization and scalability

## Installation
To install the framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourframework.git
    cd yourframework
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that third-party tools like OWASP ZAP and SQLmap are installed and accessible via the command line.

4. Install `pdfkit` and `wkhtmltopdf` for PDF report generation:
    - For `pdfkit`:
      ```bash
      pip install pdfkit
      ```
    - For `wkhtmltopdf`, download and install from [here](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).

## Configuration
Create or edit the configuration file at `config/default_config.yaml` to customize the framework's behavior:

```yaml
scanner:
  sql_injection: true
  xss: true
  csrf: false
  auth_bypass: true
  custom_headers:
    User-Agent: "WebAppPenTestFramework"
    Accept-Language: "en-US"

attack_engine:
  timeout: 5
  retries: 2
  payloads:
    sql_injection: ["' OR '1'='1", "' OR 'a'='a"]
    xss: ["<script>alert('XSS')</script>"]

reporting:
  output_format: "pdf"
  report_path: "./results/"
  include_details: true

zap:
  api_key: "your-zap-api-key"
  url: "http://localhost:8080"
