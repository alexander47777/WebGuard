## 📘 Introduction
**[Framework Name]** is a customizable penetration testing framework designed for web application security testing. It automates common security assessments, including vulnerability scans and attack simulations, providing comprehensive reports for developers and security professionals.

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Automated vulnerability scanning** (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
- 🔌 **Integration with third-party tools** such as OWASP ZAP and SQLmap
- 🔒 **SSL/TLS checks** for certificate analysis
- 🛡️ **Header security analysis** for HTTP header compliance
- 📄 **Comprehensive PDF reporting**
- 🔧 **Modular structure** for easy customization and scalability

## ⚙️ Installation
To install the framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourframework.git
    cd yourframework
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Ensure that third-party tools like OWASP ZAP and SQLmap are installed** and accessible via the command line.

4. **Install `pdfkit` and `wkhtmltopdf` for PDF report generation**:
    - For `pdfkit`:
      ```bash
      pip install pdfkit
      ```
    - For `wkhtmltopdf`, download and install from [here](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).

## 🛠️ Configuration
Customize the framework's behavior by editing the configuration file at `config/default_config.yaml`:

```yaml
scanner:
  sql_injection: true
  xss: true
  csrf: false
  auth_bypass: true
  custom_headers:
    User-Agent: "WebAppPenTestFramework"
    Accept-Language: "en-US"

attack_engine:
  timeout: 5
  retries: 2
  payloads:
    sql_injection: ["' OR '1'='1", "' OR 'a'='a"]
    xss: ["<script>alert('XSS')</script>"]

reporting:
  output_format: "pdf"
  report_path: "./results/"
  include_details: true

zap:
  api_key: "your-zap-api-key"
  url: "http://localhost:8080"
```

## ▶️ Running the Framework
Run the framework using the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py <target_url> --config config/default_config.yaml
```
🔄 Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the web application you want to test.

## 🔍 Detailed Usage

### Using OWASP ZAP Integration
Ensure that OWASP ZAP is running on your machine and is accessible at the configured URL (default: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)).

### Using SQLmap for SQL Injection Testing
The framework can integrate SQLmap to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities. Ensure that SQLmap is installed and is accessible via the command line.

## 🧩 Modules Overview

### 📊 Scanner Module
- **Purpose**: Scans for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and XSS.
- **Customization**: Supports custom payloads defined in `default_config.yaml`.

### 🔒 SSL/TLS Check Module
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the SSL/TLS configuration of the target URL.

### 🛡️ Header Security Check Module
- **Purpose**: Evaluates HTTP headers for security compliance and common best practices.

### 🔍 OWASP ZAP Module
- **Purpose**: Automates the spidering and active scanning of web applications.
- **Output**: Retrieves alerts and details with recommended solutions.

## 📄 Generating Reports
Reports are generated in PDF format and saved in the directory specified in the configuration file (`report_path`).

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 🔗 Connection Errors
Ensure OWASP ZAP or other integrated tools are running and configured correctly.

### 📁 Missing Tools
Verify that dependencies like SQLmap and `wkhtmltopdf` are installed and in the system's PATH.
